# Adonis Starter

This repo is an implementation of a starter pack for Adonis v.4.x with some tweaks.
It is just an example of how you can implement front-end stuff and authentication.

## What's inside?

- Postgresql as a DB layer
- Auth controller (login, signup, confirm email, reset password, resend confirmation)
- Auth emails (welcome email, reset password email)
- Webpack config
- LESS + ES2015
- Folder structure for views

## Details

## How to use
To use this repo, you can clone it, or even install via `adonis` command:
`adonis new <PATH> --blueprint=git@github.com:keeross/adonis-starter.git`

## How to run
A very basic adonis command is `adonis serve --dev`.
In order to run webpack, you have to open a new terminal window in the same folder and run `npm run watch`, for dev env, and `npm run build` for production.

## PS
There is a lot of stuff to be done, I will fix them asap
